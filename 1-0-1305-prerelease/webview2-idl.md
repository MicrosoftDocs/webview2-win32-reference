#### CompareBrowserVersions

> public STDAPI [CompareBrowserVersions](#comparebrowserversions)(PCWSTR version1, PCWSTR version2, int * result)

This method is for anyone want to compare version correctly to determine which version is newer, older or same.

Use it to determine whether to use webview2 or certain feature based upon version. Sets the value of result to `-1`, `0` or `1` if `version1` is less than, equal or greater than `version2` respectively. Returns `E_INVALIDARG` if it fails to parse any of the version strings or any input parameter is `null`. Directly use the `versionInfo` obtained from `GetAvailableCoreWebView2BrowserVersionString` with input, channel information is ignored.

#### CreateCoreWebView2Environment

> public STDAPI [CreateCoreWebView2Environment](#createcorewebview2environment)(ICoreWebView2CreateCoreWebView2EnvironmentCompletedHandler * environmentCreatedHandler)

Creates an evergreen WebView2 Environment using the installed WebView2 Runtime version.

This is equivalent to running `CreateCoreWebView2EnvironmentWithOptions` with `nullptr` for `browserExecutableFolder`, `userDataFolder`, `additionalBrowserArguments`. For more information, navigate to `CreateCoreWebView2EnvironmentWithOptions`.

#### CreateCoreWebView2EnvironmentWithOptions

> public STDAPI [CreateCoreWebView2EnvironmentWithOptions](#createcorewebview2environmentwithoptions)(PCWSTR browserExecutableFolder, PCWSTR userDataFolder, ICoreWebView2EnvironmentOptions * environmentOptions, ICoreWebView2CreateCoreWebView2EnvironmentCompletedHandler * environmentCreatedHandler)

DLL export to create a WebView2 environment with a custom version of WebView2 Runtime, user data folder, and with or without additional options.

When WebView2 experimental APIs are used, make sure to provide a valid `environmentOptions` so that WebView2 runtime knows which version of the SDK that the app is using. Otherwise, WebView2 runtime assumes that the version of the SDK being used is the latest version known to it, which might not be the version of the SDK being used. This wrong SDK version assumption could result in some experimental APIs not being available.

The WebView2 environment and all other WebView2 objects are single threaded and have dependencies on Windows components that require COM to be initialized for a single-threaded apartment. The app is expected to run `CoInitializeEx` before running `CreateCoreWebView2EnvironmentWithOptions`.

```text
CoInitializeEx(nullptr, COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED);
```

If `CoInitializeEx` did not run or previously ran with `COINIT_MULTITHREADED`, `CreateCoreWebView2EnvironmentWithOptions` fails with one of the following errors.

```text
CO_E_NOTINITIALIZED -  if CoInitializeEx was not called
RPC_E_CHANGED_MODE  -  if CoInitializeEx was previously called with
                       COINIT_MULTITHREADED
```

Use `browserExecutableFolder` to specify whether WebView2 controls use a fixed or installed version of the WebView2 Runtime that exists on a user machine. To use a fixed version of the WebView2 Runtime, pass the folder path that contains the fixed version of the WebView2 Runtime to `browserExecutableFolder`. BrowserExecutableFolder supports both relative (to the application's executable) and absolute files paths. To create WebView2 controls that use the installed version of the WebView2 Runtime that exists on user machines, pass a `null` or empty string to `browserExecutableFolder`. In this scenario, the API tries to find a compatible version of the WebView2 Runtime that is installed on the user machine (first at the machine level, and then per user) using the selected channel preference. The path of fixed version of the WebView2 Runtime should not contain `\Edge\Application\`. When such a path is used, the API fails with `HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED)`.

The default channel search order is the WebView2 Runtime, Beta, Dev, and Canary. When an override `WEBVIEW2_RELEASE_CHANNEL_PREFERENCE` environment variable or applicable `releaseChannelPreference` registry value is set to `1`, the channel search order is reversed.

You may specify the `userDataFolder` to change the default user data folder location for WebView2. The path is either an absolute file path or a relative file path that is interpreted as relative to the compiled code for the current process. For UWP apps, the default user data folder is the app data folder for the package. For non-UWP apps, the default user data (`{Executable File Name}.WebView2`) folder is created in the same directory next to the compiled code for the app. WebView2 creation fails if the compiled code is running in a directory in which the process does not have permission to create a new directory. The app is responsible to clean up the associated user data folder when it is done.

> [!NOTE]
> As a browser process may be shared among WebViews, WebView creation fails with `HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_INVALID_STATE)` if the specified options does not match the options of the WebViews that are currently running in the shared browser process.

`environmentCreatedHandler` is the handler result to the async operation that contains the `WebView2Environment` that was created.

The `browserExecutableFolder`, `userDataFolder` and `additionalBrowserArguments` of the `environmentOptions` may be overridden by values either specified in environment variables or in the registry.

When creating a `WebView2Environment` the following environment variables are verified.

```text
WEBVIEW2_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE_FOLDER
WEBVIEW2_USER_DATA_FOLDER
WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS
WEBVIEW2_RELEASE_CHANNEL_PREFERENCE
```

If you find an override environment variable, use the `browserExecutableFolder` and `userDataFolder` values as replacements for the corresponding values in `CreateCoreWebView2EnvironmentWithOptions` parameters. If `additionalBrowserArguments` is specified in environment variable or in the registry, it is appended to the corresponding values in `CreateCoreWebView2EnvironmentWithOptions` parameters.

While not strictly overrides, additional environment variables may be set.

```text
WEBVIEW2_WAIT_FOR_SCRIPT_DEBUGGER
```

When found with a non-empty value, this indicates that the WebView is being launched under a script debugger. In this case, the WebView issues a `Page.waitForDebugger` CDP command that runs the script inside the WebView to pause on launch, until a debugger issues a corresponding `Runtime.runIfWaitingForDebugger` CDP command to resume the runtime.

> [!NOTE]
> The following environment variable does not have a registry key equivalent: `WEBVIEW2_WAIT_FOR_SCRIPT_DEBUGGER`.

When found with a non-empty value, it indicates that the WebView is being launched under a script debugger that also supports host apps that use multiple WebViews. The value is used as the identifier for a named pipe that is opened and written to when a new WebView is created by the host app. The payload should match the payload of the `remote-debugging-port` JSON target and an external debugger may use it to attach to a specific WebView instance. The format of the pipe created by the debugger should be `\\.\pipe\WebView2\Debugger\{app_name}\{pipe_name}`, where the following are true.

* `{app_name}` is the host app exe file name, for example, `WebView2Example.exe`

* `{pipe_name}` is the value set for `WEBVIEW2_PIPE_FOR_SCRIPT_DEBUGGER`

To enable debugging of the targets identified by the JSON, you must set the `WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS` environment variable to send `--remote-debugging-port={port_num}`, where the following is true.

* `{port_num}` is the port on which the CDP server binds.

> [!WARNING]
> If you set both `WEBVIEW2_PIPE_FOR_SCRIPT_DEBUGGER` and `WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS` environment variables, the WebViews hosted in your app and associated contents may exposed to 3rd party apps such as debuggers.

> [!NOTE]
> The following environment variable does not have a registry key equivalent: `WEBVIEW2_PIPE_FOR_SCRIPT_DEBUGGER`.

If none of those environment variables exist, then the registry is examined next. The following registry values are verified.

```text
[{Root}]\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Edge\WebView2\BrowserExecutableFolder
"{AppId}"=""

[{Root}]\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Edge\WebView2\ReleaseChannelPreference
"{AppId}"=""

[{Root}]\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Edge\WebView2\AdditionalBrowserArguments
"{AppId}"=""

[{Root}]\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Edge\WebView2\UserDataFolder
"{AppId}"=""
```

Use a group policy under **Administrative Templates** > **Microsoft Edge WebView2** to configure `browserExecutableFolder` and `releaseChannelPreference`.

In the unlikely scenario where some instances of WebView are open during a browser update, the deletion of the previous WebView2 Runtime may be blocked. To avoid running out of disk space, a new WebView creation fails with `HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_DISK_FULL)` if it detects that too many previous WebView2 Runtime versions exist.

The default maximum number of WebView2 Runtime versions allowed is `20`. To override the maximum number of the previous WebView2 Runtime versions allowed, set the value of the following environment variable.

```text
WEBVIEW2_MAX_INSTANCES
```

If the Webview depends upon an installed WebView2 Runtime version and it is uninstalled, any subsequent creation fails with `HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_PRODUCT_UNINSTALLED)`.

First verify with Root as `HKLM` and then `HKCU`. `AppId` is first set to the Application User Model ID of the process, then if no corresponding registry key, the `AppId` is set to the compiled code name of the process, or if that is not a registry key then `*`. If an override registry key is found, use the `browserExecutableFolder` and `userDataFolder` registry values as replacements and append `additionalBrowserArguments` registry values for the corresponding values in `CreateCoreWebView2EnvironmentWithOptions` parameters.

The following summarizes the possible error values that can be returned from `CreateCoreWebView2EnvironmentWithOptions` and a description of why these errors occur.

Error value   |Description
--------- | ---------
`CO_E_NOTINITIALIZED`|CoInitializeEx was not called.
`RPC_E_CHANGED_MODE`|CoInitializeEx was previously called with COINIT_MULTITHREADED.

#### GetAvailableCoreWebView2BrowserVersionString

> public STDAPI [GetAvailableCoreWebView2BrowserVersionString](#getavailablecorewebview2browserversionstring)(PCWSTR browserExecutableFolder, LPWSTR * versionInfo)

Get the browser version info including channel name if it is not the WebView2 Runtime.

Channel names are Beta, Dev, and Canary. If an override exists for the `browserExecutableFolder` or the channel preference, the override is used. If an override is not specified, then the parameter value passed to `GetAvailableCoreWebView2BrowserVersionString` is used.

The caller must free the returned string with `CoTaskMemFree`. See [API Conventions](/microsoft-edge/webview2/concepts/win32-api-conventions#strings).
